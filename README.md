### Hi, my name is Dominik ðŸ‘‹
#### I am second year student at the University of WrocÅ‚aw currently studying both computer science and mathematics!

#### My pashion? Games! I love playing different types of games, mostly card and strategy games (both board and video), but also RPGs, survival, roguelikes and metroidvanias. Besides playing I am also getting into game development, mostly focusing on design and balance. My biggest project so far is a roguelike game called Trixure (repo link: https://github.com/qwertyzk/Trixure).
